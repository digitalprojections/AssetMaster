# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/6e75cf24-8457-4b13-a686-3e2d5537d112

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Deploy To created.link

Run:

`npm run deploy`

This builds the app, publishes `dist` to `https://created.link/assetmaster/`, and verifies that the live page is serving the newly built asset hash.
